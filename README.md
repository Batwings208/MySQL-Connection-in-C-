# MySQL-Connection-in-CSharp
MySQL is a database where you can send and pull data from. Databases are used by many companies and is also how they store most of their information.
I used C# or CSharp to make the connection. C#/CSharp is a very good programming language used for making applications. I used this code in Visual Studios so I hope you know how to download the package requirement to run the imports.

IMPORTANT: Read Intructions!

Enjoy! Thanks! ðŸ˜Š
